# :smiling_imp: Annoy your Friend with wisdom per minute :smiling_imp:

## Project Files :books:

There are 3 project files.

- `index.py` is the main file of the project which has the code to annoy your friend
- `quotes.txt`contains the raw quotes in txt file
- `gitignore` is an important file to not push the ENV file which has the password of my mail or your mail for that matter. It is just an additional security tool.

## Libraries :computer:

The project uses 6 Python libraries

- `random` to choose a random quote
- `time` to make the while loop wait for 1 second at least so that it does not overload every milisecond
- `datetime` is crucial library for this project. it provides all things dealing with date and time
- `smtplib` well we do need something to send the mails, so here it is
- `os` to access the ENV
- `dotenv` to be able to create and load the ENV

## Important points :loudspeaker:	

- You will face an error related to PASSWORD during the mail sending process through your email, so create an app password for your mail beforehand and add it to the ENV instead. ADD APP PASSWORD, NOT ACTUAL EMAIL PASSWORD
- You may not want to run this on your PC for long if you really wanna annoy your friend so you can host this program on CLOUD for **Free**, go to [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
- For collaboration or improvement, you can send me request and i will happily add you as a collaborator.
- This project is just to improve your understanding of Python and build the logic, not to actually annoy someone (well it is! that's why i uploaded it :wink: )
